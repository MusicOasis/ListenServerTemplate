/// dynamic data such as a match score here.
/// - Line 3, `In a group (2 of 3)` describes the _party_ the player is in. "Party" is used to refer
/// to a group of players in a shared context, such as a lobby, server, team, etc. The first half,
/// `In a group` is powered by the `state` field in the activity, and the second half, `(2 of 3)` is
/// powered by the `party` field in the activity and describes how many people are in the current
/// party and how big the party can get.
///

///
///
/// \image html "rich_presence.png" "Rich presence field diagram" width=1070px
///
/// You can also specify up to two custom buttons to display on the rich presence.
/// These buttons will open the URL in the user's default browser.
///
/// \code
///     discordpp::ActivityButton button;
///     button.SetLabel("Button 1");
///     button.SetUrl("https://example.com");
///     activity.AddButton(button);
/// \endcode
///
///
/// ## Invites / Joinable Activities
/// Other users can be invited to join the current player's activity (or request to join it too),
/// but that does require certain fields to be set:
/// 1. ActivityParty must be set and have a non-empty ActivityParty::Id field. All users in the
/// party should set the same id field too!
/// 2. ActivityParty must specify the size of the group, and there must be room in the group for
/// another person to join.
/// 3. ActivitySecrets::Join must be set to a non-empty string. The join secret is only shared with
/// users who are accepted into the party by an existing member, so it is truly a secret. You can
/// use this so that when the user is accepted your game knows how to join them to the party. For
/// example it could be an internal game ID, or a Discord lobby ID/secret that the client could
/// join.
///
/// There is additional information about game invites here:
/// https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001557452-Game-Invites
///
/// ### Mobile Invites
/// Activity invites are handled via a deep link. To enable users to join your game via an invite in
/// the Discord client, you must do two things:
/// 1. Set your deep link URL in the Discord developer portal. This will be available on the General
/// tab of your application once Social Layer integration is enabled for your app.
/// 2. Set the desired supported platforms when reporting the activity info in your rich presence,
/// e.g.:
///
///
/// \code
///     activity.SetSupportedPlatforms(
///         ActivityGamePlatforms.Desktop |
///         ActivityGamePlatforms.IOS |
///         ActivityGamePlatforms.Android);
/// \endcode
///
///
/// When the user accepts the invite, the Discord client will open:
/// `[your url]/_discord/join?secret=[the join secret you set]`
///
/// ### Example Invites Flow
/// If you are using Discord lobbies for your game, a neat flow would look like this:
/// - When a user starts playing the game, they create a lobby with a random secret string, using
/// Client::CreateOrJoinLobby
/// - That user publishes their RichPresence with the join secret set to the lobby secret, along
/// with party size information
/// - Another use can then see that RichPresence on Discord and join off of it
/// - Once accepted the new user receives the join secret and their client can call
/// CreateOrJoinLobby(joinSecret) to join the lobby
/// - Finally the original user can notice that the lobby membership has changed and so they publish
/// a new RichPresence update containing the updating party size information.
///
/// ### Invites Code Example
///
/// \code
/// // User A
/// // 1. Create a lobby with secret
/// std::string lobbySecret = "foo";
/// client->CreateOrJoinLobby(lobbySecret, [=](discordpp::ClientResult result, uint64_t lobbyId) {
///     // 2. Update rich presence with join secret
///     discordpp::Activity activity{};
///     // set name, state, party size ...
///     discordpp::ActivitySecrets secrets{};
///     secrets.SetJoin(lobbySecret);
///     activity.SetSecrets(secrets);
///     client->UpdateRichPresence(std::move(activity), [](discordpp::ClientResult result) {});
/// });
/// // 3. Some time later, send an invite
/// client->SendActivityInvite(USER_B_ID, "come play with me", [](auto result) {});
///
/// // User B
/// // 4. Monitor for new invites. Alternatively, you can use
/// // Client::SetActivityInviteUpdatedCallback to get updates on existing invites.
/// client->SetActivityInviteCreatedCallback([client](auto invite) {
///     // 5. When an invite is received, ask the user if they want to accept it.
///     // If they choose to do so then go ahead and invoke AcceptActivityInvite
///     client->AcceptActivityInvite(invite,
///         [client](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string secret) {
///         if (result.Successful()) {
///             // 5. Join the lobby using the joinSecret
///             client->CreateOrJoinLobby(secret, [](discordpp::ClientResult result, uint64_t
///             lobbyId) {
///                 // Successfully joined lobby!
///             });
///         }
///     });
/// });
/// \endcode
///
///
/// ### Join Requests Code Example
/// Users can also request to join each others parties. This code snippet shows how that flow might
/// look:
///
/// \code
/// // User A
/// // 1. Create a lobby with secret
/// std::string lobbySecret = "foo";
/// client->CreateOrJoinLobby(lobbySecret, [=](discordpp::ClientResult result, uint64_t lobbyId) {
///     // 2. Update rich presence with join secret
///     discordpp::Activity activity{};
///     // set name, state, party size ...
///     discordpp::ActivitySecrets secrets{};
///     secrets.SetJoin(lobbySecret);
///     activity.SetSecrets(secrets);
///     client->UpdateRichPresence(std::move(activity), [](discordpp::ClientResult result) {});
/// });
///
/// // User B
/// // 3. Request to join User A's party
/// client->SendActivityJoinRequest(USER_A_ID, [](auto result) {});
///
/// // User A
/// // Monitor for new invites:
/// client->SetActivityInviteCreatedCallback([client](auto invite) {
///     // 5. The game can now show that User A has received a request to join their party
///     // If User A is ok with that, they can reply back:
///     // Note: invite.type will be ActivityActionTypes::JoinRequest in this example
///     client->SendActivityJoinRequestReply(invite, [](auto result) {});
/// });
///
/// // User B
/// // 6. Same as before, user B can monitor for invites
/// client->SetActivityInviteCreatedCallback([client](auto invite) {
///     // 7. When an invite is received, ask the user if they want to accept it.
///     // If they choose to do so then go ahead and invoke AcceptActivityInvite
///     client->AcceptActivityInvite(invite,
///         [client](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string secret) {
///         if (result.Successful()) {
///             // 5. Join the lobby using the joinSecret
///             client->CreateOrJoinLobby(secret, [](auto result, uint64_t lobbyId) {
///                 // Successfully joined lobby!
///             });
///         }
///     });
/// });
/// \endcode

/// ## Managing Lobbies
/// Lobbies can be managed through a set of @ref server_apis that are documented elsewhere, which
/// allow you to create lobbies, add and remove users from lobbies, and delete them.
///
/// There is also an API to create lobbies without any server side component using the
/// Client::CreateOrJoinLobby function, which accepts a game-generated secret and will join the user
/// to the lobby associated with that secret, creating it if necessary.
///
/// NOTE: When using this API the secret will auto-expire in 30 days, at which point the existing
/// lobby can no longer be joined, but will still exist. We recommend using this for short term
/// lobbies and not permanent lobbies. Use the Server API for more permanent lobbies.
///
/// Members of a lobby are not automatically removed when they close the game or temporarily
/// disconnect. When the SDK connects, it will attempt to re-connect to any lobbies it is currently
/// a member of.
///
/// # Lobby Auto-Deletion
/// Lobbies are generally ephemeral and will be auto-deleted if they have been idle (meaning no
/// users are actively connected to them) for some amount of time. The default is to auto delete
/// after 5 minutes, but this can be customized when creating the lobby. As long as one user is
/// connected to the lobby though it will not be auto-deleted (meaning they have the SDK running and
/// status is set to Ready). Additionally, lobbies that are linked to a channel on Discord will not
/// be auto deleted.
///
/// You can also use the @ref server_apis to customize this timeout, it can be raised to as high as
/// 7 days, meaning the lobby only gets deleted if no one connects to it for an entire week. This
/// should give a good amount of permanence to lobbies when needed, but there may be rare cases
/// where a lobby does need to be "rebuilt" if everyone is offline for an extended period.
///
/// # Membership Limits
/// Lobbies may have a maximum of 1,000 members, and each user may be in a maximum of 200 lobbies
/// per game.
///
/// ## Audio
/// Lobbies support voice calls. Although a lobby is allowed to have 1,000 members, you should not
/// try to start voice calls in lobbies that large. We strongly recommend sticking to around 25
/// members or fewer for voice calls.
///
/// See Client::StartCall for more information on how to start a voice call in a lobby.
///
/// ## Channel Linking
/// Lobbies can be linked to a channel on Discord, which allows messages sent in one place to show
/// up in the other. Any lobby can be linked to a channel, but only lobby members with the
/// LobbyMemberFlags::CanLinkLobby flag are allowed to a link a lobby. This flag must be set using
/// the server APIs, which allows you to ensure that only clan/guild/group leaders can link lobbies
/// to Discord channels.
///
/// To setup a link you'll need to use methods in the Client class to fetch the servers (aka guilds)
/// and channels a user is a member of and setup the link. The Client::GetUserGuilds and
/// Client::GetGuildChannels methods are used to fetch the servers and channels respectively. You
/// can use these to show a UI for the user to pick which server and channel they want to link to.
///
/// Not all channels are linkable. To be linked:
/// - The channel must be a guild text channel
/// - The channel may not be marked as NSFW
/// - The channel must not be currently linked to a different lobby
/// - The user must have the following permissions in the channel in order to link it:
///   - Manage Channels
///   - View Channel
///   - Send Messages
///
/// ### Linking Private Channels
/// Discord is allowing all channels the user has access to in a server to be linked in game, even
/// if that channel is private to other members of the server. This means that a user could choose
/// to link a private "admins chat" channel (assuming they are an admin) in game if they wanted.
///
/// It's not really possible for the game to know which users should have access to that channel or
/// not though. So in this implementation, every member of a lobby will be able to view all messages
/// sent in the linked channel and reply to them. If you are going to allow private channels to be
/// linked in game, you must make sure that users are aware that their private channel will be
/// viewable by everyone in the lobby!
///
/// To help you identify which channels are public or private, we have added a
/// isViewableAndWriteableByAllMembers boolean which is described more in GuildChannel. You can use
/// that to just not allow private channels to be linked, or to know when to show a clear warning,
/// it's up to you!
///
/// ## Misc
/// Handle objects in the SDK hold a reference both to the underlying data, and to the SDK instance.

/// \brief A MessageHandle represents a single message received by the SDK.

/// # Chat types

/// 1. 1 on 1 chat between two users
/// 2. Chat within a lobby
///
/// You can determine the context a message was sent in with the MessageHandle::Channel and
/// ChannelHandle::Type methods. The SDK should only be receiving messages in the following channel
/// types:
/// - DM
/// - Ephemeral DM
/// - Lobby
///
/// # Syncing with Discord
/// In some situations messages sent from the SDK will also show up in Discord.
/// In general this will happen for:
/// - 1 on 1 chat when at least one of the users is a full Discord user
/// - Lobby chat when the lobby is linked to a Discord channel
///
/// Additionally the message must have been sent by a user who is not banned on the Discord side.
///
/// # Legal disclosures
/// As a convenience for game developers, the first time a user sends a message in game, and that
/// message will show up on the Discord client, the SDK will inject a "fake" message into the chat,
/// that contains a basic English explanation of what is happening to the user. You can identify
/// these messages with the MessageHandle::DisclosureType method. We encourage you to customize the
/// rendering of these messages, possibly changing the wording, translating them, and making them
/// look more "official". You can choose to avoid rendering these as well.
///
/// # History
/// The SDK keeps the 25 most recent messages in each channel in memory, but it does not have access
/// to any historical messages sent before the SDK was connected. A MessageHandle will keep working
/// though even after the SDK has discarded the message for being too old, you just won't be able to
/// create a new MessageHandle objects for that message.
///
/// # Unrenderable Content
/// Messages sent on Discord can contain content that may not be renderable in game, such as images,
/// videos, embeds, polls, and more. The game isn't expected to render these, but instead show a
/// small notice so the user is aware there is more content and a way to view that content on
/// Discord. The MessageHandle::AdditionalContent method will contain data about the non-text
/// content in this message.
///
/// There is also more information about the struct of messages on Discord here:
/// https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message
///
/// Note: While the SDK allows you to send messages on behalf of a user, you must only do so in
/// response to a user action. You should never automatically send messages.
///
/// Handle objects in the SDK hold a reference both to the underlying data, and to the SDK instance.
/// Changes to the underlying data will generally be available on existing handles objects without
/// having to re-create them. If the SDK instance is destroyed, but you still have a reference to a

    ///
    /// ## Overview
    /// If you're not familiar with OAuth2, some basic background: At a high level the goal of
    /// OAuth2 is to allow a user to connect two applications together and share data between them.
    /// In this case, allowing a game to access some of their Discord data. The high level flow is:
    /// - This function, Authorize, is invoked to start the OAuth2 process, and the user is sent to
    /// Discord
    /// - On Discord, the user sees a prompt to authorize the connection, and that prompt explains
    /// what data and functionality the game is requesting.
    /// - Once the user approves the connection, they are redirected back to your application with a
    /// secret code.
    /// - You can then exchange that secret code to get back an access token which can be used to
    /// authenticate with the SDK.
    ///
    /// ## Public vs Confidential Clients
    /// Normal OAuth2 requires a backend server to handle exchanging the "code" for a "token" (the
    /// last step mentioned above). Not all games have backend servers or their own identity system
    /// though, and for early testing of the SDK that can take some time to setup.
    ///
    /// If desired, you can instead change your Discord application in the developer portal (on the
    /// OAuth2 tab), to be a "public" client. This will allow you to exchange the code for a token
    /// without a backend server, by using the GetToken function below. You can also change this
    /// setting back once you have a backend in place later too.
    ///
    /// ## Overlay
    /// To streamline the authentication process, the SDK will attempt to use the Discord overlay if
    /// it is enabled. This will allow the user to authenticate without leaving the game, enabling a
    /// more seamless experience.
    ///
    /// You should check to see if the Discord overlay works with your game before shipping. It's
    /// ok if it doesn't though, the SDK will fall back to using a browser window. Once you're ready
    /// to ship, you can work with us to have the overlay enabled by default for your game too.
    ///
    /// If your game's main window is not the same process that the SDK is running in, then you need
    /// to tell the SDK the PID of the window that the overlay should attach to. You can do this by
    /// calling Client::SetGameWindowPid.
    ///
    /// ## Redirects
    /// For the Authorize function to work, you must configure a redirect url in your Discord
    /// application in the developer portal, (it is located on the OAuth2 tab).
    /// - For desktop applications, add `http://127.0.0.1/callback`
    /// - For mobile applications, add `discord-APP_ID:/authorize/callback`
    ///
    /// The SDK will then spin up a local webserver to handle the OAuth2 redirects for you as
    /// well to streamline your integration.
    ///
    /// ## Security
    /// This function accepts an args object, and two of those values are important for security:
    /// - To prevent CSRF attacks during auth, the SDK automatically attaches a state and checks it
    /// for you when performing the authorization. You can override state if you want for your own
    /// flow, but please be mindful to keep it a secure, random value.
    /// - If you are using the Client::GetToken function you will need to provide a "code challenge"
    /// or "code verifier". We'll spare you the boring details of how that works (woo… crypto), as
    /// we've made a simple function to create these for you,
    /// Client::CreateAuthorizationCodeVerifier. That returns a struct with two items, a `challenge`
    /// value to pass into this function and a `verifier` value to pass into Client::GetToken.
    ///
    /// ## Callbacks & Code Exchange
    /// When this flow completes, the given callback function will be invoked with a "code". That
    /// code must be exchanged for an actual authorization token before it can be used. To start,
    /// you can use the Client::GetToken function to perform this exchange. Longer term private apps
    /// will want to move to the server side API for this, since that enables provisional accounts
    /// to "upgrade" to full Discord accounts.
    ///
    /// ## Android
    /// You must add the appropriate intent filter to your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
